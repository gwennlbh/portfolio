my portfolio :)

its deployed on github actions, but since i want different subdomains per language, the site is actually built separately in two different repos (you can't have multiple gh pages sites on a single repo): [portfolio-build-en](https://github.com/gwennlbh/portfolio-build-en) and [portfolio-build-fr](https://github.com/gwennlbh/portfolio-build-fr)

like any other web dev freak, my portfolio is a playground for web dev tech exploration, and has thus been rewritten an unreasonable amount of times:

- 2025 with [Astro](https://astro.build) and [ortfo/db](https://github.com/ortfo/db)
- 2023 with [Go Templ](https://templ.guide) and [ortfo/db](https://github.com/ortfo/db)
- 2021 with [ortfo/mk](https://github.com/ortfo/mk-old) and [ortfo/db](https://github.com/ortfo/db)
- 2020 with [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com) alone
- 2020 with [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com) and [django rest framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)
- 2020 with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) and [django](https://djangoproject.com)
- 2019 with [Django](https://djangoproject.com)
- 2018 with [PHP](https://php.net) (first webdev project ^^)
